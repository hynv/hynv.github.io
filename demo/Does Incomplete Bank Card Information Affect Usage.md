# Does Incomplete Bank Card Information Affect Usage?

## The Growing Requirement for Customer Data Verification

Recent announcements from multiple regional banks, including Fujian Ningde Rural Commercial Bank and Nanping Rural Commercial Bank, have sparked widespread discussion. These institutions now require customers to verify and complete personal information such as name, gender, and residential address. According to Wind data, at least 24 banks issued similar identity information governance notices in the first half of 2025 alone. Starting June 2025, financial institutions will begin suspending non-counter services for accounts with incomplete identity records, while others will progressively restrict financial operations for accounts containing inaccurate, invalid, or expired data.

## Regulatory Framework Driving Data Compliance

### New Anti-Money Laundering Legislation

The implementation of China's updated **Anti-Money Laundering Law** on January 1, 2025, marks a pivotal shift in financial compliance. Key provisions include:

- Mandatory updates of changed customer identification information
- Continuous monitoring of client identity status during business relationships
- Required cessation of services for accounts with expired documents not updated within reasonable periods

These regulations align with global financial crime prevention standards while addressing domestic vulnerabilities in regional banking systems.

### Customer Due Diligence Requirements

The **Administrative Measures for Customer Due Diligence and Identity Records Preservation** further specify:

1. Ongoing review of customer profiles
2. Documentation expiration tracking systems
3. Standardized procedures for information verification

These measures directly impact how banks manage customer databases and enforce account restrictions.

## Practical Impacts of Incomplete Data

### Service Restrictions Explained

Banks implementing these policies typically enforce the following limitations:

| Restriction Type          | Affected Transactions                | Duration       |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------|
| Non-counter service block | Online transfers, mobile banking     | Immediate      |
| Partial transaction limits| ATM withdrawals, POS payments      | Progressive    |
| Complete service cessation| All electronic and branch operations | After 30 days  |

Failure to update information like expired ID cards, changed addresses, or outdated phone numbers directly triggers these limitations.

### Financial Consequences

Customers facing restrictions may encounter:

- Failed salary transfers or automatic bill payments
- Inability to access emergency funds
- Disrupted investment portfolio management
- Compromised business transaction capabilities

## Evolution of Banking Data Practices

### Past Challenges in Customer Verification

Historically, some regional banks prioritized card issuance volume over rigorous identity verification, resulting in:

- Incomplete customer profiles (missing ID numbers, contact details)

This data deficiency created vulnerabilities exploited by financial criminals for money laundering and fraud schemes.

### Technological Advancements in Compliance

Modern banks now employ sophisticated systems for:

1. Automated document expiration tracking
2. AI-powered identity verification
3. Biometric authentication integration
4. Real-time risk assessment algorithms

These technologies enable efficient compliance while maintaining customer convenience.
