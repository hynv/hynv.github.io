# Solana Price Surges 4% as $33M ETF Launch Drives Bullish Momentum Toward $168 Target  

## Market Catalyst: First Solana Staking ETF Ignites Institutional Interest  

Solana (SOL) recently surged 4% to surpass $154, fueled by the debut of the first-ever Solana staking ETF (ticker: SSK) on the Cboe exchange. This groundbreaking financial instrument generated $33 million in trading volume and $12 million in institutional inflows during its inaugural day, marking a significant milestone for blockchain-based asset integration into traditional finance.  

The SSK ETF enables investors to gain indirect exposure to Solana's staking rewards through smart contract mechanisms, eliminating direct custody risks via Anchorage Digital's institutional-grade infrastructure. While still modest compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, SSK's performance outpaces XRP futures ETF launches, signaling growing institutional validation for Solana's ecosystem.
