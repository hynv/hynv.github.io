### Centralized vs Decentralized Exchanges

Crypto trading primarily occurs through two exchange types:

| Exchange Type       | Key Features                                  | Security Considerations                  |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Centralized (CEX)   | Order books, custodial wallets, fiat on/off ramps | Exchange-controlled private keys         |
| Decentralized (DEX) | Liquidity pools, non-custodial wallets, AMM systems | User-controlled private keys             |

CEX platforms like Binance and Coinbase offer beginner-friendly interfaces and advanced trading tools, while DEX platforms like Uniswap prioritize user control and privacy through automated market maker (AMM) systems.

## Developing Effective Trading Strategies

Successful crypto trading requires strategic planning and risk management. Three primary trading approaches dominate the market:

### Day Trading
- **Timeframe:** Minutes to hours
- **Tools:** Real-time charts, technical indicators
- **Risk Profile:** High
Day traders capitalize on short-term price movements, often executing dozens of trades daily. This approach demands constant market monitoring and quick decision-making.

### Swing Trading
- **Timeframe:** Days to weeks
- **Tools:** Technical analysis, support/resistance levels
- **Risk Profile:** Moderate
Swing traders aim to capture price "swings" by identifying medium-term trends. This strategy balances active trading with practical time commitments.

### Position Trading
- **Timeframe:** Weeks to months
- **Tools:** Fundamental analysis, macroeconomic indicators
- **Risk Profile:** Long-term market exposure
Position traders focus on broader market trends and project fundamentals, requiring patience and strategic vision.

**FAQ: Which trading style suits beginners best?**
For new traders, position trading offers a more manageable entry point due to its longer timeframe and reduced need for constant monitoring. However, starting with small positions across multiple styles can help determine personal preferences.
