| RSI             | 47.21         | Increasing bearish momentum    |

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Why did ME experience such a sharp price drop?**  
The combination of immediate sell pressure from airdrop recipients, technical difficulties during distribution, and market uncertainty created perfect conditions for a significant correction.

**What makes the ME airdrop different from others?**  
This distribution represented a substantial 12.5% of total supply, significantly higher than typical airdrop allocations which usually range between 1-5%.

**Is this price level historically significant?**  
Yes - ME is currently trading just above its all-time low of $4.13, making this critical support level a key market focus.

## Technical Outlook

### Potential Scenarios

- **Bearish Case**: Failure to defend $4.50 support could lead to retesting $4.13
- **Bullish Recovery**: Strong buying interest at current levels might drive prices toward $9.66 resistance
