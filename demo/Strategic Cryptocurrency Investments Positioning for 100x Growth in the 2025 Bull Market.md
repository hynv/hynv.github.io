### Market Structure Analysis
The current environment reveals a unique divergence between institutional-grade assets and speculative tokens. While BTC and ETH maintain strong technical foundations, many altcoins exhibit weak volume metrics and poor price retention. This polarization underscores the importance of strategic positioning in proven blockchain ecosystems.

**FAQ: Why is Bitcoin's $60,000 level significant?**  
This psychological threshold has historically marked the transition from accumulation to parabolic growth phases. Maintaining support here suggests institutional buying pressure remains intact.
