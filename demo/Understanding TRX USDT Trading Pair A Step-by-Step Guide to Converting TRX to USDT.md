### 2. Create and Verify Your Account  
Register on the chosen platform and complete identity verification (KYC). This step is mandatory for compliance and enhances account security. Verification typically requires submitting government-issued ID documents and proof of address.  

### 3. Deposit TRX to Your Exchange Wallet  
Navigate to the exchangeâ€™s wallet section and locate the TRX deposit address. Transfer your TRX tokens from an external wallet to the provided address. Confirm the transaction on the blockchain, which may take several minutes depending on network congestion.  

### 4. Access the TRX/USDT Trading Interface  
Once the TRX deposit is confirmed, proceed to the exchangeâ€™s trading platform. Use the search function to find the TRX/USDT pair and open its trading chart. Familiarize yourself with the order book, market depth, and current price data.  

### 5. Place a Sell Order  
Decide between a **market order** (instant execution at the best available price) or a **limit order** (set a target price for conversion). Enter the TRX amount to sell and review transaction details, including fees. Confirm the order to proceed.  

### 6. Withdraw USDT to a Secure Wallet  
After the sale completes, check your exchange balance for USDT. For enhanced security, transfer the USDT to a hardware wallet or a trusted software wallet. This minimizes exposure to exchange-related risks like hacking or insolvency.
