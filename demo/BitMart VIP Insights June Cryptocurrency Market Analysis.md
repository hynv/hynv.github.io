## 1. Macroeconomic Landscape

### Inflation Trends and Monetary Policy

US inflation data for June 2025 reveals a **core CPI of 3.4% YoY**, with monthly gains remaining flat at 0.2%. While this marks a moderation from recent peaks, the Federal Reserve maintains its cautious stance, emphasizing the need for "sustained disinflationary evidence" before initiating rate cuts. 

**Labor Market Resilience**: Unemployment rises marginally to 4.5%, still reflecting a robust jobs market. However, retail sales decline 0.9% MoM â€“ the steepest drop in four months â€“ as high borrowing costs suppress discretionary spending.

**Policy Outlook**: The Fed holds rates at 4.25%-4.5%, marking its fourth consecutive pause. While markets price in potential rate cuts by Q4 2025, hawkish dissent within the Fed grows, particularly regarding inflation risks. The dot plot indicates growing internal divergence, with 53% of officials favoring at least one rate cut this year.

### Geopolitical and Trade Dynamics

Escalating Middle East conflicts trigger sharp risk-off sentiment, particularly after Israeli airstrikes on Iranian targets. Temporary relief emerges with the US-China trade dialogue resumption in London, though renewed hostilities quickly overshadow diplomatic optimism. Trump's surprise ceasefire announcement on June 22 catalyzes crypto market rebounds, demonstrating the sector's sensitivity to global stability signals.
