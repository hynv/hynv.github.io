## Understanding Ethereum Wallets  

### What Is an Ethereum Wallet?  
Ethereum wallets securely store private and public keys. The **private key** acts as a digital signature proving ownership, while the **public key** serves as your wallet address for receiving funds. Wallets come in various forms:  

| **Wallet Type** | **Pros** | **Cons** |  
|------------------|----------|----------|  
| Software Wallets | Free, accessible | Vulnerable to malware |  
| Hardware Wallets | High security | Higher cost |  
| Online Wallets   | Easy to use | Risk of phishing |  
| Mobile Wallets   | Portability | Device-dependent security |  

### Why Use an Ethereum Wallet?  
- Direct control over digital assets  
- Access to DeFi platforms and DApps  
- Secure ETH storage without third-party custodians
