Coinbase will also integrate Stripe's fiat-to-crypto onramp into **Coinbase Wallet**, enabling users to purchase cryptocurrencies via credit cards and Apple Pay.  

> "These three key integrations lay a strong foundation for Stripe and Coinbase to build a better payments future," Coinbase stated.  

### Expanding Global Crypto Access  
Stripe's renewed focus on crypto aligns with its mission to simplify global transactions. By leveraging Base's low-cost, Ethereum-compatible infrastructure, the partnership aims to:

- Accelerate settlement times.  
- Provide seamless cross-border payment solutions.

## Stripe's Crypto Resurgence  

### A Strategic Return to Digital Assets  
Stripe first experimented with Bitcoin payments in 2014 but paused crypto support in 2018 due to scalability issues. However, the company has reentered the space since 2022, driven by:  
- Growing institutional and retail demand for stablecoins.  
- Advances in Layer 2 solutions like Polygon and Base.  

In April 2024, Stripe launched USDC payouts for Twitter creators on **Solana and Ethereum** networks. By mid-2024, it expanded support to include **MetaMask's fiat on-ramp** for U.S. users.  

> "Crypto is back. Stripe will support global stablecoin payments this summer," said John Collison, Stripe's co-founder and president.  

### Addressing Past Challenges  
Stripe acknowledged Bitcoin's limitations as a payment medium but emphasized stablecoins' potential to bridge traditional finance and blockchain ecosystems. The company now prioritizes:  
- Instant on-chain settlements.  
- Automated fiat conversion.  
- Regulatory-compliant infrastructure.
