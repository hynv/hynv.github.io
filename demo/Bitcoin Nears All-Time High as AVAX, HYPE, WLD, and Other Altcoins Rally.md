# Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as AVAX, HYPE, WLD, and Other Altcoins Rally

## Bitcoin's Market Position
Bitcoin (BTC) continues to dominate the cryptocurrency landscape, trading at $109,779 - just 1.8% below its recent all-time high of $111,814 set four days prior. This remarkable price action demonstrates Bitcoin's growing institutional adoption and macroeconomic significance. While BTC gained only 2.2% in the last 24 hours, its proximity to record levels has created favorable conditions for broader market participation.

### Key Market Drivers
The recent rally coincides with geopolitical developments affecting global trade policies. Market analysts attribute this correlation to increased investor speculation about potential economic stimulus measures and their impact on digital asset valuations.

### Worldcoin's Regulatory Journey
Worldcoin (WLD) experienced a 27.2% price increase despite earlier restrictions on US participation in its biometric identity system. This rebound highlights growing interest in privacy-focused cryptocurrency projects and their potential applications in digital identity verification.

## Bitcoin Dominance Trends
According to CoinGecko data, Bitcoin's market dominance has grown from 36.95% in late 2022 to 61.12% today. This trend reflects BTC's role as a primary gateway for institutional investors entering the crypto space. However, analysts predict that dominance could stabilize around 70% before altcoins experience broader adoption.

### eToro Analyst Insights
Reece Hobson of eToro Australia recently noted: "We're approaching the critical 70% dominance threshold. Once quantitative easing measures materialize and BTC dominance plateaus, we could see a significant altseason emerge." This prediction suggests careful monitoring of both macroeconomic indicators and altcoin market capitalization movements.
