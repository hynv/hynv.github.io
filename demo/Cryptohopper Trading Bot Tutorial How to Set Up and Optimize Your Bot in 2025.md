## How Cryptohopper Works: From Strategy to Execution  

Cryptohopper operates as a semi-automated trading bot, requiring users to define parameters while executing trades autonomously. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of its workflow:  

### 1. **Strategy Design**  
- **Pre-Built Templates**: Beginners can select from pre-configured strategies tailored to specific market conditions (e.g., bull, bear, or sideways markets).

### 2. **Signal Generation**  
Cryptohopper monitors market data in real time, generating buy/sell signals based on your selected parameters. For instance, a strategy might trigger a Litecoin purchase if its 50-period moving average crosses above the 200-period average.  

### 3. **Trade Execution**  
Once a signal is generated, the bot connects to your exchange via API to execute trades. Supported platforms include Binance, KuCoin, and Coinbase, ensuring broad accessibility.  

### 4. **Risk Management**  
Automate risk mitigation by setting:  
- **Stop-Loss Orders**: Limit losses if the market moves against you.  
- **Trailing Stops**: Lock in profits during bullish trends.  
- **Take-Profit Levels**: Secure gains once a target price is reached.  

### 5. **Performance Optimization**
