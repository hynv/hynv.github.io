- **Supply adjustments**: XQG rewards decrease every 2 million blocks, incentivizing early adopters.
- **Dynamic allocation**: Early XQC holders receive proportionally higher XQG rewards.

This dual-token model ensures network sustainability while rewarding long-term stakeholders, distinguishing QURAS from traditional staking protocols.
